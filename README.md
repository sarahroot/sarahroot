- 👋 Hi, I’m @sarahroot, an MD/PhD student in Biophysics at UChicago!
- 👀 I’m interested in biological physics, mechanobiology, and cytoskeletal simulation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about autoencoding, image analysis, and neural network architectures. 
- 🧠 I'm currently researching mechanotransduction on the actin cytoskeleton and models of actin flow.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning.
- 📫 How to reach me: sroot@uchicago.edu
